## 1 - Starting the Conversation
* If you are going door to door, start with a friendly knock. 
* Say that you are a Christian/Denomination right away (eg Baptist) so they don't mistake you for a Jehovah's witness. 
* Say that you are there to invite people to Church
* Cut to the chase don't waste people's time: let them know who you are and why you are there
* Ask questions but don't interrogate people

### Figure out their beliefs first:
* Are you a Christian? A Lot of people will give you a positive answer
* Do you go to church anywhere?

**If they say yes to the above**, ask them if they were to die today, would they go to Heaven? If they __don't__ say “yes for sure” and have doubt, then present the gospel. _“Well, the Bible says we can know for sure, can i show you where?”_

**If they say no to the above answers**, start off by asking if they mind if they show you from the Bible how you can go to Heaven.

**If they're not interested**, still leave on a positive note. Leave them with a card/tract. Tell them about a youtube video to watch/link. 

Say _“No worries, can I just leave you with one quick verse?”_ 9/10 people will accept that verse.

Could be John 3:16, and then expound on it e.g _“Notice how the verse doesnt say “whosoever do good works, or go to church, or live a good life. Alright God bless you have a great day.”_ Every once in a while they may give a positive reaction and want to hear more. _“Well hey, let me show you a little more?”_

**If they say the right answer:** _“Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ!”_

Follow up with _“Well, Do you think there is anything you can do to lose that salvation?” _

### Personal life - Friends, Family, Coworkers
Great opportunities for discipleship as you see them frequently. 

If you are alone with someone, give them the gospel. 

How do you start the conversation? Bring up the topic of Church. 

_“Do you go to church anywhere?” “Are you a Christian?”_

And then go on from the same way you do at the door.  

_“Well more important than that.. Do you know if you died today would you go to Heaven?”_

_**Important: You must truly love people - being nice/friendly comes naturally and comes from the heart. People will sense that.**_
